<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>A boat I sail on has discussed tying a stopper knot in the topping lift, so we can drop the spinaker pole to the right height without having to look down at the line. Afterall, &quot;head up&quot; is always better for boat awareness.</p>
<p>The knot cannot stay in the line permanently, as we need to remove it to stow the spinnaker pole, so it must be fast and easy to tie and untie. Finally, the knot must go in the middle of a long line, unlike the usual stopper knots that would go on an end, so it cannot require feeding an end through something.</p>
<p>I based the following on the Ashley Stopper Knot, a personal favorite.</p>
<h2 id="steps-to-tie">Steps to tie</h2>
<h3 id="start">Start</h3>
<p>Begin with a piece of line. Here the right side would go to the clutch or fairlead that the stopper will stop against, and the left side is the free end.</p>

<h3 id="make-loops">Make loops</h3>
<p>Make a pair of loops pulling the two sides toward you and twisting in. Both ends should be on the inside, and should cross above the middle part.</p>

<h3 id="feed-right-loop-into-left">Feed right loop into left</h3>
<p>Take the right side loop, the one that leads to the clutch or fairlead, and feed it through the left side loop.</p>

<h3 id="pull-right-loop-tight">Pull right loop tight</h3>
<p>Hold the knot and pull on the right side loop until the left side loop is tight and the right side loop is loose.</p>

<p>When this step is done, the knot should look like this.</p>

<h2 id="fold-right-loop-under">Fold right loop under</h2>
<p>Fold the right loop around and under the knot, so it's up against the lines emerging from the bottom, and grip the knot in you hand to keep the loop tight against those lines. You can do this in one step, but it's easier to photograph as two.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="pull-right-side-line-tight">Pull right side line tight</h2>
<p>Pull on the right side line, the one that goes back to the clutch or fairlead, until the knot is tight.</p>
<figure>
<img src="08_pull_right_line_tight.jpg" alt="Pull right side tight" /><figcaption>Pull right side tight</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once it is tight, you might pull on the left hand line, the one that goes to the free end, to make sure it is tight too.</p>
<h2 id="finished-knot">Finished knot</h2>
<p>When done, the finished knot should look like this.</p>
<figure>

<h1 id="untying">Untying</h1>
<p>To untie, pull some slack from the line that goes to the clutch into the loop that goes around the knot, which was the old right side loop.</p>
<p>Bring that loop back to the top of the knot.</p>
<p>Pull on the line that goes back to the clutch to pop the loop out.</p>
